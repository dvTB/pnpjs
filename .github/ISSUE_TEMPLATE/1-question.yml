      I'm struggling to get a list item. Here is the code I'm running. Can anyone help me figure out what's wrong?
      
      ```TypeScript
      import { spfi } from "@pnp/sp";
      import "@pnp/sp/webs";
      import "@pnp/sp/lists";
      import "@pnp/sp/items";

      const sp = spfi(...);

      // get all the items from a list
      const items: any[] = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle("My List").items();
      console.log(items);
      ```
